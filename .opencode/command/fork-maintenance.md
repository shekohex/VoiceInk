# Task: Fork Maintenance

1. Follow @FORK_MAINTENANCE.md document to update the current fork with latest upstream changes.
2. If there any merge/rebase conflicts, you review the conflicts and ask me what to do with these changes.
3. once all of the conflicts are resolved we start building the new app version following @build-voiceink-pro.sh script and @BUILD_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md
4. fix any issues during the build until it builds
5. once it builds we push the updates to our fork.


Think harder on this problem, by thinking step by step and breakdown the task into smaller chunks/todos.
